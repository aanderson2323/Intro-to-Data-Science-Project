##Is the distribution of the number of entries statistically different between rain & non rainy days?
_Answer_:yes
##Describe your results and the methods used:
_Answer_: Rainy day entries mean: 1105.44, Non-Rainy day entries mean: 1090.28. p-value from the Mann Whitney U Test: .025. The null hypothesis of is that the two samples are equal. The Mann Whitney U test produced a p value of .025 which would be considered significantly different under either a one tailed (p<.05) or two tailed (p<.025) test. We have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
