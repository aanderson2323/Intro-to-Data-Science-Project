##Does entries data from the previous exercise seem normally distributed?
_Answer_: no

##Can we run Welch's T test on entriesdata? Why or why not?
_Answer_: We can run Welch's T test if we think there is enough data or a large enough sample size. However, it may be more useful to use a non-parametric test like the Mann-Whitney U test
